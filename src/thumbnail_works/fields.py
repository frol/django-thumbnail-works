class EnhancedImageField(ImageField):
    """This model field is an enhanced version of Django's ``ImageField``.
    
    *django-thumbnail-works* provides an enhanced version of the default Django's
    ``ImageField``, which supports:
    
    - Processing the original image before it is saved on the remote server.
    - Generating thumbnails of the source image and a mechanism of accessing
      the thumbnails as attributes of the source image.
    
    The ``EnhancedImageField`` derives from the default ``ImageField`` and thus
    all attributes and methods of the default ``ImageField`` are inherited.
    
    In addition to the default arguments, the ``EnhancedImageField`` also
    supports the following:
    
    ``process_source``
        A dictionary of *image processing options*. The same options, that can
        be used for the thumbnail generation, can also be set in this attribute.
        If this is set, the original image will be processed using the provided
        options before it is saved on the remote server. Contrariwise, if this
        attribute is not set or set to ``None``, the uploaded image is saved in
        its original form, without any further processing. It should be noted that
        setting this attribute to an empty dictionary still causes the source
        image to be processed using default image processing options. This
        practically means that the source image will be saved in the format
        specified by the ``THUMBNAILS_FORMAT`` setting without any resizing or
        filtering taking place.
    ``thumbnails``
        A dictionary of *thumbnail definitions*. The format of each thumbnail
        definition is::
    
            <thumbnail_identifier> : <image_processing_options>
        
        **thumbnail_identifier**
            Is a string that uniquely identifies the thumbnail. It is required
            that all thumbnails use a unique identifier. This identifier is used
            in the thumbnail access mechanism and is also used in the
            generated filename of the thumbnail image file.
        **image_processing_options**
            This is a dictionary of options that will be used during the thumbnail
            generation. This dictionary must be present on every thumbnail
            definition. Any of the following supported options may be used:
            
            ``size``
                A string of the format ``WIDTHxHEIGHT`` which represents the
                size of the generated thumbnail.
            ``sharpen``
                Boolean option. If set, the ``ImageFilter.SHARPEN`` filter will
                be applied to the thumbnail.
            ``detail``
                Boolean option. If set, the ``ImageFilter.DETAIL`` filter will
                be applied to the thumbnail.
            ``upscale``
                Boolean option. By default, image resizing occurs only if
                any of the source image dimensions is bigger than the dimension
                indicated by the ``size`` option. If the ``upscale`` option is
                set to ``True``, resizing occurs even if the generated thumbnail
                is bigger than the source image.
            ``format``
                This is the format in which the thumbnail should be saved.
                Valid values are those supported by the *Python Imaging Library*
                (PIL). If it is not set, then the default format specified by
                the ``THUMBNAILS_FORMAT`` setting will be used. In case the
                format is set to ``JPEG``, the value of the ``THUMBNAILS_QUALITY``
                is used as the quality when the image is saved.
    
    The following code snippet illustrates how to use the ``EnhancedImageField``::

        from django.db import models
        from thumbnail_works.fields import EnhancedImageField
        
        class MyModel(models.Model):
