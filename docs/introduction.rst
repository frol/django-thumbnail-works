Introduction
============

This section contains an introduction to *django-thumbnail-works*, including general
information about how to submit bug reports and make feature requests.

*django-thumbnail-works* provides an enhanced ImageField that generates and
manages thumbnails of the source image.

This application aims to be a simple but feature rich thumbnailing
application for Django based projects.

Licensed under the *Apache License version 2.0*. More licensing information
exists in the license_ section.

**Warning**: This software is not production-ready!


Features
========

- Provides the ``EnhancedImageField`` model field, which is based on the
  default Django ``ImageField``, and has the ability to generate and manage
  thumbnails of the source image.
- Supports *named* thumbnails which can be accessed as attributes of the
  source image.
- Uses the Django storages API to manage thumbnails.
- Allows processing the source image in the same manner that thumbnails are
  processed.
- Individual processing options for each thumbnail.
- Supports automatic image resizing and cropping to the user specified size.
  Scaling up smaller images is also possible.
- *Sharpen* and *detail* filters.
- You can specify the output format of each image, including the format of the
  source image.
- Supports delayed thumbnail generation, which means that thumbnails are
  generated the first time they are accessed.

Thumbnail generation using template tags is not supported and there are
no plans to support it in the near future. The logic of this application
is to define *named* thumbnails and access them as attributes of the source
image. This way you only need to create your own template tags that display
the thumbnails in any way you see fit.
