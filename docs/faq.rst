==========================

This section contains answers to frequently asked questions or to questions
every new user would like to ask the author of django-thumbnail-works.


Donations
=========

**Is this software free?**
    django-thumbnail-works is released under the terms of the *Apache License version 2*,
    therefore it is free software, which you can download, use or build upon.
    However, a significant amount of time and effort has gone into developing
    this software and writing this documentation. So, the production of this
    software has not been free from cost. It is highly recommended that, if
    you use this software *in production*, you should consider making a
    donation.

**Please define use-in-production**
    *Use-in-production* refers to using this software to power a web site
    or to develop derivative works which are used to power a web site
    on the internet or in a corporate intranet.

**How much should I donate?**
    This is totally up to you. If we all made a one dollar donation to each
    piece of free software we use in production, this world would have been
    a better place for the developers of free software.

**How do I make a donation?**
    Please visit the CodeTRAX `donations page`_ which contains a PayPal_
    *donate* button. Thank you for considering making a
    donation to django-thumbnail-works.

**What is CodeTRAX?**
    CodeTRAX_ is a private project hosting service. It was launched by
    *George Notaras* in the first quarter of 2007 to facilitate the
    centralized management and organization of his software and
    documentation projects.

Support
=======

**I have a support question. Can I email you?**
    No. It is not possible to answer questions via email about how to integrate
    this application into your Django project or into your own Django app. This
    is not because I do not want to, but because I do not have the time to do
    so. Sorry.

**I have asked a question in the public forums but noone has answered**
    Please understand that this might happen in forums that are supported
    by a community of volunteers.

**I am looking for commercial support**
    Unfortunately, commercial support is not available at this time.
